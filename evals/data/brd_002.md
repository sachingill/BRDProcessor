# Problem
Support team misses SLA targets because ticket triage is manual.

# Objectives
- Cut mean time to respond
- Provide an audit trail

# Functional Requirements
- Ingest chat transcripts
- Auto-assign a ticket owner

# Non-Functional Requirements
- 99.9% uptime
- PII redaction

# Constraints
- Must use the existing CRM

# Dependencies
- Access to the ticket system API

# Assumptions
- Support team uses tags consistently
